  BNL-RHIC.  Yields, correlation shapes, and mean transverse momenta $p_{T}$ of charged particles associated with intermediate to high-$p_{T}$ trigger particles $(2.5 < p_{T} < 10 \frac{GeV}{c})$ in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV are presented. For associated particles at higher $p_{T} \gtrsim 2.5 \frac{GeV}{c}$, narrow correlation peaks are seen in d+Au and Au+Au, indicating that the main production mechanism is jet fragmentation. At lower associated particle $p_{T} < 2$ \GeVc, a large enhancement of the near- ($\Delta \phi \sim 0$) and away-side ($\Delta \phi \sim \pi$) associated yields is found, together with a strong broadening of the away-side azimuthal distributions in Au+Au collisions compared to d+Au measurements, suggesting that other particle production mechanisms play a role. This is further supported by the observed significant softening of the away-sid
