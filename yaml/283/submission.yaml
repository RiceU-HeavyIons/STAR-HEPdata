  cocktail yields in the mass region of 0.76–1.2 GeV/c2 in both collisions is also shown for comparison.

  dashed lines represent the p2T distributions for the photon-photon process from two models [33,34] within the STAR acceptance in 60%–80%
  Au + Au collisions. The dashed lines illustrate the corresponding p2T distributions for e+e− pairs from the model [33] traversing 1 fm in
  a constant magnetic field of 10^14 T perpendicular to the beam line.
