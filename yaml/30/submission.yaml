comment: BNL-RHIC. Identified mid-rapidity particle spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $p(\bar{p})$ from 200 GeV p+p and d+Au collisions are reported. A time-of-flight detector based on multi-gap resistive plate chamber technology is used for particle identification. The particle-species dependence of the Cronin effect is observed to be significantly smaller than that at lower energies. The ratio of the nuclear modification factor $(R_{dAu})$ between protons $(p + \bar{p})$ and charged hadrons $(h)$ in the transverse momentum range $1.2 < p_T < 3.0 GeV/c$ is measured to be 1.19$\pm$0.05(stat)$\pm$0.03(syst) in minimum-bias collisions and shows little centrality dependence. The yield ratio of $(p + \bar{p})/h$ in minimum-bias d+Au collisions is found to be a factor of 2 lower than that in Au+Au collisions, indicating that the Cronin effect alone is not enough to account for the relative baryon enhancement observed in heavy ion collisions at RHIC.
