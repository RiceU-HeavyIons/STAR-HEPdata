comment: BNL-RHIC. Transverse mass and rapidity distributions for charged pions, charged kaons, protons and antiprotons are reported for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV pp and Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The transverse mass distributions are rapidity independent within $|y| < 0.5$, consistent with a boost-invariant system in this rapidity interval. Spectral shapes and relative particle yields are similar in pp and peripheral Au+Au collisions and change smoothly to central Au+Au collisions. No centrality dependence was observed in the kaon and antiproton production rates relative to the pion production rate from medium-central to central collisions. Chemical and kinetic equilibrium model fits to our data reveal strong radial flow and relatively long duration from chemical to kinetic freeze-out in central Au+Au collisions. The chemical freeze-out temperature appears to be independent of initial conditions at RHIC energies.
