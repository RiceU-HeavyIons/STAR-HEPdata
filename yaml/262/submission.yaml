centralities. The centrality increases from left to right for a given
energy. The data points other than BES energies are taken from
Refs. [43,66]. Uncertainties represent systematic uncertainties."

" (a) Energy dependence of kinetic and chemical freezeout temperatures for central heavy-ion collisions. The curves represent various theoretical predictions [81,82]. (b) Energy dependence
of average transverse radial flow velocity for central heavy-ion
collisions. The data points other than BES energies are taken from
Refs. [43,53–64,66] and references therein. The BES data points
are for 0–5% central collisions, AGS energies are mostly for 0–5%,
SPS energies are for mostly 0–7%, and top RHIC and LHC energies
are for 0–5% central collisions. Uncertainties represent systematic
uncertainties."
