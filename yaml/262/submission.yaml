description: "Midrapidity (|y| < 0.1) transverse momentum spectra for (e) p in Au+Au
  collisions at \u221AsNN = 39 GeV for different centralities. The spectra for centralities
  other than 0\u20135% are scaled for clarity as shown in the figure. The curves represent
  the Bose-Einstein, mT -exponential, and double-exponential function fits to 0\u20135%
  central data for pions, kaons, and (anti)protons, respectively. The uncertainties
  are statistical and systematic added in quadrature.\n"
