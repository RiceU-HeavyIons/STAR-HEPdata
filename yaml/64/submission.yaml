comment: |
  BNL-RHIC.  The STAR Collaboration at RHIC reports measurements of azimuthal correlations of high transverse momentum ($p_T$) charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at higher $p_T$ than reported previously. As $p_T$ is increased, a narrow, back-to-back peak emerges above the decreasing background, providing a clear dijet signal for all collision centralities studied. Using these correlations, we perform a systematic study of dijet production and suppression in nuclear collisions, providing new constraints on the mechanisms underlying partonic energy loss in dense matter.
