comment: BNL-RHIC. Inclusive transverse momentum distributions of charged hadrons within $0.2<p_T<6.0$ GeV/c have been measured over a broad range of centrality for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =130$ GeV. Hadron yields are suppressed at high $p_T$ in central collisions relative to peripheral collisions and to a nucleon-nucleon reference scaled for collision geometry. Peripheral collisions are not suppressed relative to the nucleon-nucleon reference. The suppression varies continuously at intermediate centralities. The results indicate significant nuclear medium effects on high $p_T$ hadron production in heavy ion collisions at high energy.
