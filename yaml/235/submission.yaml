description: (Left) Unlike-sign/like-sign pair acceptance difference correction factor with the PHENIX phi acceptance (black stars) compared with the full acceptance (red circles). (Right) Dielectron pair mass distributions of the STAR data within the PHENIX phi acceptance; the inclusive unlike-sign distribution (black), the same-event like-sign distribution (blue), and the mixed-event unlike-sign (red), like-sign (magenta) distributions.

location: Data from Figure 47 (Cocktail)
description: (Left) Efficiency-corrected invariant-mass spectra (blue solid dots) calculated using the STAR data filtered with the PHENIX azimuthal angle acceptance. The data points are compared to cocktail simulations shown as curves and the bottom left panel shows the ratio of data to the cocktail sum. (Right) The same data points compared to theoretical model calculations of medium vector meson and QGP contributions from Ref. [52]. The bottom right panel shows the ratio of data to the sum of the cocktail and the theory calculations of medium contributions.
